<!-- // At present we send request using fetch(), but in older days we were requesting using XMLHttpRequest

// ---------------------------------------- XMLHttpRequest ------------------------------------------

// It is still in use in so many frameworks

states :-
            value 0 means state is UNSENT  (client has been created. open() not yet called) (means request not sent yet)
            value 1 means OPENED state (open() has been called ) (means request has been sent)
            value 2 means HEADER_RECIEVED state (send() has been called, and headers and status are available.)
            value 3 means LOADING state (Downloading; responseText holds partial data)
            value 4 means DONE state (the operation is complete) -->
