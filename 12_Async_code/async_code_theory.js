// JS is synchronous code by default
// single threaded language by default
// compare to some(multi threaded) language it is slow language




// execution context

// executes one line of code at a time
// each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

// console.log("one");
// console.log("two");

// log-one will execute first then log-two will execute (log-two will wait for log-one to get executed) 

// call stack and memory heap also getting created




//// Blocking code vs Non Blocking code

// Blocking code will block the flow of program (executes file Synchronousley)

// Non Blocking code does not block the flow of program (executes file Asynchronousley)

// Browsers does not have file reading functionality, NodeJs have this functionality


// based on use case we need to write blocking or non-blocking code








// for JS engine and Web API diagram follow the video 4 hr 9 minutes (js-2)
// In JS engine only memory heap and call stack is there
// If we want we can take web API or Node Js environment saperately
// if we will take web API then we will get DOM API
// if we will take Node js environment then DOM API is not present
